# m365-physical-badging-connector-sample-scripts
This repository includes sample scripts for pushing organization's physical badging records, to be consumed by Microsoft's Insider Risk Management compliance solution. 

This repository includes a powershell script, a postman script ans a sample file containing physical badging records. You can send up to 100K records per API call.

## Creating AAD APP

 Note the following
 - APP_ID (aka Application ID or Client)
 - APP_SECRET (aka client secret)
 - TENANT_ID (aka directory ID)

## Create your job on M365 Compliance portal

Follow the steps in [Set up Physical Badging Connector](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2133516) to get started.
Provide the required details, create an M365 Physical badging connector job and note the **JOB_ID**

## Run the powershell script
```powershell
.\push_physical_badging_records.ps1 -tenantId "<Tenant Id>" -appId "<AAD App Id>" -appSecret "<AAD App Secret>" -jobId "<Job Id>" -jsonFilePath "<JSON_FILE_PATH>"
```

JSON_FILE_PATH must be the local file path for the json data file.

If the last line reads **Upload Successful**, the script execution was successful.

The script would retry  over a period of about 15 mins if it encounters any transient failures.
